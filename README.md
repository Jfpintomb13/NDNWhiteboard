NDN Shared Whiteboard Project
======================
This project is a real-time shared whiteboard that works over Named Data Networking (NDN).

The Named Data Networking (NDN) project aims to develop a new Internet architecture that can
capitalize on strengths — and address weaknesses — of the Internet’s current host-based,
point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of
communication. By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms data into a first-class
entity.
